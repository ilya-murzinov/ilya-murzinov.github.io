Earlier today I've passed Oracle Certified Java 6 Professional (OCJP, 1Z0-851) exam with the **100% score**.

I chose Java 6 because my current work project uses it and also I didn't want to pass two exams (Java 7 exam consists of OCJA and OCJP parts).

I spent about 2 month preparing for this exam and used the following materials:

 - [SCJP Sun Certified Programmer for Java 6 Exam 310-065](http://www.amazon.com/SCJP-Certified-Programmer-Java-310-065/dp/0071591060) by Kathy Sierra and Bert Bates. This great book is really easy to read and it prepares you for every aspect of the exam
 - [Enthuware](http://www.enthuware.com/) mock exam, it contains 800+ questions which are averagely more tough than real exam questions
