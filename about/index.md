####Hi there!

My name is Ilya and I'm a professional Java developer and enthusiast Android developer.

I graduated from Saint-Petersburg State University in 2013 with a Specialist Degree (5 years) in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science.

Ð¡urrently I'm working at T-System as Java developer and specialize in back-end Java development, service-oriented architecture, REST, SOAP services, etc.

I also have an experience with the .NET platform as a QA automation engineer, specifically, developing test automation framework and couple of libraries.

I'm passionate about the open-source and contribute to lots of open-source projects, you can see my activity in my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/ilya-murzinov). Here are some of my open-source projects:

 1. [WAIL](https://github.com/artem-zinnatullin/android-wail-app) (see it on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.artemzin.android.wail&referrer=utm_source%3Dgithub)) - Last.FM Scrobbler for Android. This project was started by [@artemzin](artem-zinnatullin), but I'm supporting it and developing new features since July'2014.
 1. [TestStack.White](https://github.com/ilya-murzinov/White) - test automation framework for .NET platform. I was actively contributing to this project for about a half a year and submitted 14 pull-requests.
 1. [WhiteSharp](https://github.com/ilya-murzinov/WhiteSharp) - my own test automation framework based on TestStack.White which makes test automation even more easy. I developed it for my previous job, so it's not widely used, but still works.
 1. [Shouldly](https://github.com/shouldly/shouldly) - assertion framework which focuses on giving great error messages when the assertion fails while being simple and terse. I was actively contributing to this project for about a half a year and submitted 9 pull-requests.
 1. [Allure-csharp-commons](https://github.com/ilya-murzinov/allure-csharp-commons) - C# implementation of [Allure](http://allure.qatools.ru/) core classes such as event definitions, lifecycle entry point, exceptions. My own project.
 1. [Allure-nunit](https://github.com/ilya-murzinov/allure-nunit) - [Allure](http://allure.qatools.ru/) adapter for NUnit framework. My own project.
