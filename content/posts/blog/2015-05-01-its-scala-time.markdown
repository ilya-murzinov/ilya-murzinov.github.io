<!-- TEASER START -->

I've been very busy at work lately, because I was transfered to new project and there is a lot of stuff to learn. But now things settled down a bit so I'm back and ready to continue my open-source activities.

<!-- TEASER STOP -->

I was looking to learn something new and finally decided to concentrate on Scala because

 - It's both functional and object-oriented
 - It runs on JVM
 - It has great community and lots of new projects use it
 - I believe that it will be in demand for a long time
 - I have some experience with it
 
My plan is quite standard:

 - Take again the [Functional Programming Principles in Scala](https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun) course on Cousera to remember (learn) the basics
 - Develop some stuff just for fun
 - Find an open-sorce project and start contributing to it
