I've just finished amazing course [Algorithms Part 1](https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partI) by Robert Sedgewick from Princeton University on Coursera. This course finally me quite full understanding of basic algorithms, data structures and analysis of algorithms.

I can proudly say that I've reached highest score in every programming assignment. But I did not do so great in exercises.

Here are my final grades:

| Programming Assignments |
|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Programming Assignment 1: Percolation                  | 100/100     |
| Programming Assignment 2: Randomized Queues and Deques | 100/100     |
| Programming Assignment 3: Collinear Points             | 100/100     |
| Programming Assignment 4: 8 Puzzle                     | 100/100     |
| Programming Assignment 5: Kd-Trees                     | 100/100     |

| Exercises |
|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| Union Find                                             | 2/3         |
| Analysis of Algorithms                                 | 3/3         |
| Stacks and Queues                                      | 2/3         |
| Elementary Sorts                                       | 1.8/3       |
| Mergesort                                              | 2.67/3      |
| Quicksort                                              | 1.60/3      |
| Priority Queues                                        | 1.80/3      |
| Binary Search Trees                                    | 1.40/3      |
| Balanced Search Trees                                  | 1.60/3      |
| Geometric Searching Applications of BSTs               | 0.0/3       |
| Hash Tables                                            | 2.60/3      |
|--------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| **Final Exam**                                         | 7.1/10      |

Of course, I will not share any of my solutions in any form other than personal e-mail.

I will definitely join [second part](https://www.coursera.org/course/algs4partII) of this course.
